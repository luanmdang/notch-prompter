# Notch Prompter (macOS)  
Turn your notch into a teleprompter!

Notch-Prompter is a minimal, native macOS teleprompter that expands directly from the MacBook notch.

Designed for presenters, creators, and anyone who wants to maintain natural eye-contact with the camera. Hover over the notch (or use a hotkey) and a small teleprompter panel smoothly expands from the notch, displaying your script exactly where your eyes already are!

Inspired by my love for the amazing Alcove app for Mac.

## Ideas for your own build
Have it recognize the words you're saying and automatically scroll based on your completion of the script!

Add other productivity tools within it.
