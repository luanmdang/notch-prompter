# Notch Prompter (macOS)  
Turn your notch into a teleprompter! 

Notch-Prompter is a minimal, native macOS teleprompter that expands directly from the MacBook notch.
(Okay... the actual activation area is not so perfect... it's slightly at the edge the notch)

Open-source Swift + SwiftUI + AppKit menu bar app designed for creators, presenters, and anyone who wants to maintain natural eye-contact on camera. Hover over the notch (or use a hotkey) and a small teleprompter panel smoothly rolls down beneath the camera, displaying your script exactly where your eyes already are.

Heavily inspired by the amazing Alcove app for Mac.

## ✨ Features
- **Notch-activated teleprompter:** Hover near the notch and the panel animates downward.
